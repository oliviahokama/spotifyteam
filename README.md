Our team chose to work with Spotify, and more specifically music in general, as our area of interest.
For many of us, music represents a constant and consistent source of enjoyment, and provides
a much needed accompaniment to many parts of our lives. We chose this domain not only because we
love music, but also because we believe that music can show us interesting trends across
generations and allow us to better understand the preferences of the general population.

[This interesting article](https://medium.com/artists-and-machine-intelligence/neural-nets-for-generating-music-f46dffac21c0) 
documents the recent progress of trying to use a neural network to compose music. It's fascinating
because we don't often think of music as something that can be fabricated down to an algorithm, and
yet that's exactly what is happening here. 
[This article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/upshot/music-fandom-maps.html) maps
out 50 different artists from the top 100, and then plots their popularity and density in the US. It
is similar to what we want to look at, and also shows how there are indeed trends relating the
musical preference and location (at least in the US). 
[This last article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/09/opinion/do-songs-of-the-summer-sound-the-same.html) 
attempts to see why music produced in the summer always seems to sound the same. It, once again, fits
this idea of music being formulaic and how trends have started solidifying themselves across
generations.

While there are several different questions we think we could answer, we had a few specifically
we wanted to focus on. First, what are the identifiable trends of genre popularity across generations?
Second, are there any identifiable factors that lead to a genre becoming popular? Lastly, how
much of trending music is dominated by a single genre across generations?
